Class based components

loading a class based components means
when ever creating an  instance of class based components
on page i am creating new instance of the class 


when i am rendering function components means
on your web page if there is a functional components it loads thats means you are mounting the function or calling that function components

never update state variable directly

use this.setState{
    obj: value
}

use case of componentwillunmount(){
    clean up   
    clearInterval(this.timer) 
}


this is shared with all the function in a class
for eg  we have setInterval in componentdidmount

this.timmer = setInterval(()=>{
    console.log("hello")
},1000)
after 1 sec


to clean setinterval in function 
it called when we are unmounting the functional component 
return a function useEffect


useEffect(()=>{
    const timer = setTimer(()=>{
        
    })
    console.log(useEffect)
    return ()=>{
        clearTimer(timer)
        console.log("UseEffect Return)
    }
})
