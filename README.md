Class based components

loading a class based components means
when ever creating an  instance of class based components
on page i am creating new instance of the class 


when i am rendering function components means
on your web page if there is a functional components it loads thats means you are mounting the function or calling that function components

never update state variable directly

use this.setState{
    obj: value
}

use case of componentwillunmount(){
    clean up   
    clearInterval(this.timer) 
}


this is shared with all the function in a class
for eg  we have setInterval in componentdidmount

this.timmer = setInterval(()=>{
    console.log("hello")
},1000)
after 1 sec


to clean setinterval in function 
it called when we are unmounting the functional component 
return a function useEffect


useEffect(()=>{
    const timer = setTimer(()=>{
        
    })
    console.log(useEffect)
    return ()=>{
        clearTimer(timer)
        console.log("UseEffect Return)
    }
})


single responsibility principle react

The Single Responsibility Principle states thatÂ a component should have one clear purpose or responsibility. It should focus on specific functionality or behavior and avoid taking on unrelated tasks. Following SRP makes components more focused, modular, and easily comprehended and modified.
 

hook are just utility functions

useEffect
uswState
useParams

useRef 


controlled  vs uncontrolled components ?

when child components is contyrolled by its parents component is called controlled 

when child has its state it is uncontrolled components


props drilling ?

React Context ?

we can have many react context

can we wrap multipal provider ?

ans yes 



it solves the problem of props drilling 

in function 
 const data = useContext(userContext)

in class  

UserCOntext.Consumer

we need to have a callback function 
eg 

 <userContext.Consumer>
                    {({loggedInUser}) => (
                        <h1>{loggedInUser} </h1>
                    )  }
                </userContext.Consumer>
redux  vs context
is a state management libary 
it is seprate from react 
we need to install redux
